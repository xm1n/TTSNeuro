# Voice Assistant Design for Android MMC in Denza N9

This file outlines a potential approach for implementing a voice assistant on Android devices that communicates with an AI model over MCP and can display results on the Denza N9 car display. It also includes a mechanism for distinguishing the owner's voice from other users.

## Overview

- **Android App**: Acts as the main voice assistant. Runs on the phone or the Denza N9's Android-based MMC. It listens for voice commands, performs speech-to-text, and communicates with the AI server.
- **AI Model with MCP**: An AI model running on a host machine or in the cloud. It uses the MCP protocol to perform actions on the host. The Android app sends recognized text to this AI model, receives the results, and displays them on the car screen.
- **Voice Biometrics**: To differentiate between the owner's voice and other users, we use a speaker verification module. The owner's voice profile is registered and stored locally on the device. When a command is issued, the app checks the voice print against the stored profile.
- **Denza N9 Integration**: The Android app uses available APIs (e.g., Android Auto, Car API, or a custom display protocol) to present results on the Denza N9 display.

## Components

1. **Speech Recognition**
   - Use Android's built-in SpeechRecognizer or an offline ASR library.
   - The recognized text is sent to the AI model.
2. **Speaker Verification**
   - Implement a voice biometrics library (e.g., TensorFlow-based or open-source) to enroll the owner's voice.
   - During interaction, check if the speaker matches the enrolled profile.
3. **AI Client**
   - A module that communicates with the remote AI model using MCP. The AI model can execute actions on a host machine and return responses.
4. **Display Layer**
   - Create a simple UI on the car's screen that shows text responses or statuses returned by the AI model.

## Example Pseudocode

```kotlin
class VoiceAssistantService : Service() {
    private val aiClient = AiClient(mcpHost)
    private val speechRecognizer = SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(context)
    private val speakerVerifier = SpeakerVerifier.loadOwnerProfile(context)

    fun startListening() {
        speechRecognizer.setRecognitionListener(object : RecognitionListener {
            override fun onResults(results: Bundle?) {
                val text = results?.getString("RESULT") ?: return
                val isOwner = speakerVerifier.verify(text)
                val aiResponse = aiClient.query(text, isOwner)
                displayOnCarScreen(aiResponse)
            }
        })
        speechRecognizer.startListening(Intent(RecognizerIntent.ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH))
    }
}
```

## Considerations

- **Privacy**: Store the owner's voice profile securely and allow the owner to delete or update it at any time.
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure the app handles offline scenarios gracefully.
- **Security**: Use secure communication channels for MCP interactions.
- **User Experience**: Provide visual or audio feedback to indicate when the assistant is listening and when it has completed an action.
