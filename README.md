This repository contains a simple prototype of a voice assistant for the Denza N9 MMC. The assistant is implemented as an Android application that communicates with an external AI model. It includes a minimal UI where you can start speech recognition and see the recognized text.

To try the application, open the project with Android Studio and run it on an Android device.
